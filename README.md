# Composer installer for Innomatic Legacy stack

This installer lets you install Innomatic legacy applications and Innomatic legacy stack itself with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

It also helps you install Innomatic legacy (7.x) itself, by not deleting your settings and custom code when you upgrade to a new release.
